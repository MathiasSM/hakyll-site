There are a couple of things that might have gone wrong, from _"yes, that's definitely what happened"_, to _"in what kind of referenceable universe would that be possible"_:

1. **Almost certain**. I fell asleep on top of the keyboard at some point and messed up.

2. **Somewhat likely**. My ~~imaginary~~ dog stole my content (for money, instagram likes or breakfast).

3. **Hardly possible**. You were actually looking for my 404 page, expecting to find a funny image, gif, joke, reference or clever wording.

4. **Have never happened before, therefore it won't happen again**. I moved the content to a different URL and forgot to add a redirect here ([please let me know!](/contact)).

5. **You're smart enough not to do that, so of course you did not**. You mistyped the URL (But at this point, why bother checking?).

## In any case, the _thing_ is not here.

Maybe it was here and it's not anymore, maybe it was never here on the first place, maybe it _will_ be here (don't bet on it). You can go back, or just [look at my other blog post](/blog), or [(mostly in Spanish) writings](/escritos).
