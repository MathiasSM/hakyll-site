Hello there! My name is Mathias (with a mute "h"), and I'm a Software Development Engineer, graduated on July 2019 from _Universidad Simón Bolívar_ with a Computer Science degree. I'm currently living in Spain and working for Amazon as an SDE.

From the start of my CS studies at USB, I always picked the courses that most interested me. I chose the specializations in Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and Databases Design and Architecture. I grew fond of the last two, specially. The rest of my time on the CS world, I've

- **Worked for Amazon for 2+ years** mostly improving parts of Search,
- **Participated in coding competitions** such as ACM-ICPC and IOI,
- **Developed automation tools** to make some programming tasks easier,
- **Worked as a SysAdmin** responsible for my University's network, and
- **Given classes** to newcomers to Computer Science and Programming

I like to spend time away from code, so I watch movies, enjoy anime series and write stories from time to time. As you can see, I like stories and all forms of storytelling.

I also speak Spanish, as it's my mother tongue! I have a section here for (mostly) Spanish writings I do from time to time.
